## create-react-app (CRA)

# Setup

# JavaScript:

```bash
npx create-react-app your_project_name
cd your_project_name
npm start
```

Then you will need to edit `src/App.js` to the thing you want, in my case just a simple hello world.

# TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-react-app your_project_name --template typescript
cd your_project_name
npm start
```

Then you will need to edit `src/App.tsx` to the thing you want, in my case just a simple hello world.

Pros of JS:
It has a big community so alot of ways to search for your issues and it is proven and stable and usually ready for production right of the bat.

Pros of TS:
Can easily add a type safty with a symple `--template typescript` command adn integrates smoothly with JSX types.

Cons of JS:
Since it is big, the setup is heavy and it is usually hard to micro manage and customize but it is a good foundation.

Cons of TS:
On top of above it has a learning curve.
